That is an excellent and very advanced question. You are asking about one of the most protected and restricted features on modern mobile operating systems.

The short answer is: **No, you generally cannot force your app to open automatically from the background into a full-screen "pop-up" at a specific time.**

Both iOS and Android have extremely strict rules to prevent apps from being disruptive and taking over the user's screen without their direct, immediate interaction. An app that could suddenly open itself would be a huge security risk and a terrible user experience.

However, you **can** achieve a very similar and much more user-friendly effect by using special types of notifications. This is the professional way to handle this "wake up and interact" scenario.

### The Problem: Why Your Background Task is Not Enough

As we discussed, `expo-task-manager` gives you about **15-30 seconds** of background execution time when your scheduled notification fires.

*   This is **perfect** for a gradual light-up sequence where you are just sending quick `fetch` requests in a loop.
*   This is **not enough time** for a very long process (e.g., 30 minutes). The OS will kill your task long before it finishes.

You need a way to keep your app "alive" for a longer period, and the only way to do that is to get the user to bring your app to the foreground.

### The Solution: "Full-Screen Intent" Notifications

This is the native OS feature designed for exactly this purpose: incoming calls, alarms, and other critical, time-sensitive events.

A "full-screen intent" notification is a special high-priority notification that, instead of just showing a banner, takes over the entire screen and displays a custom UI. It essentially launches a specific screen of your app.

**How the User Experience Works:**

1.  Your scheduled notification time (e.g., 7:00 AM) arrives.
2.  The phone is locked and the screen is off.
3.  Instead of a small banner, the **entire screen wakes up** and displays a custom view that you've designed. It looks like an incoming call screen or a native alarm screen.
4.  This screen can have buttons like **"Snooze"** and **"Stop Alarm"**.
5.  When the user interacts with this screen (e.g., unlocks the phone or taps a button), they are taken directly into your app.

By bringing your app to the foreground, your JavaScript process is now fully active and can run for as long as it needs to.

### How to Implement This in Expo

Implementing this requires combining a few features from `expo-notifications`.

**Step 1: Requesting Special Permissions (Android)**

On Android, displaying over other apps requires a special permission that you must guide the user to enable in their system settings. You can check for it and prompt them.

**Step 2: Scheduling the Notification with the Right Properties**

When you schedule your notification, you need to add specific properties to tell the OS that this is a critical, full-screen alert.

Here's how you would modify your `scheduleNotificationAsync` call:

```javascript
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

const scheduleFullScreenAlarm = async (alarmDetails) => {
    const triggerDate = new Date(alarmDetails.time);

    await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
        identifier: alarmDetails.id,
        content: {
            title: 'Wake Up!',
            body: `Your alarm "${alarmDetails.title}" is starting.`,
            // --- The Critical Additions ---
            priority: Notifications.AndroidNotificationPriority.HIGH, // High priority
            sticky: true, // On Android, makes it harder to dismiss
            
            // This category identifier is key for iOS
            categoryIdentifier: 'alarm', 
        },
        trigger: triggerDate,
    });
};
```

**Step 3: Defining a Notification Category (The iOS Part)**

For iOS, to get custom buttons like "Snooze" on your notification, you must define a "category". This is done once when your app starts up (e.g., in your root `_layout.jsx`).

```javascript
// In your root _layout.jsx, when the app starts

Notifications.setNotificationCategoryAsync('alarm', [
  {
    identifier: 'snooze',
    buttonTitle: 'Snooze (9 min)',
    options: {
      // isDestructive: true,
      // isAuthenticationRequired: true,
    },
  },
  {
    identifier: 'stop',
    buttonTitle: 'Stop',
    options: {
      isDestructive: true,
    },
  },
]);
```

When you schedule a notification with `categoryIdentifier: 'alarm'`, iOS will automatically add these "Snooze" and "Stop" buttons to it.

**Step 4: Listening for Notification Responses**

When the user taps on the notification or one of its buttons ("Snooze", "Stop"), your app will open. You need a listener to "catch" this event and know what the user did.

```javascript
// In your root component (e.g., _layout.jsx)

useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
        const actionIdentifier = response.actionIdentifier;
        const alarmId = response.notification.request.content.data.alarmId;

        if (actionIdentifier === Notifications.DEFAULT_ACTION_IDENTIFIER) {
            console.log(`User opened the app by tapping the main notification for alarm: ${alarmId}`);
            // Navigate to the active alarm screen
        } else if (actionIdentifier === 'snooze') {
            console.log(`User pressed "Snooze" for alarm: ${alarmId}`);
            // Your logic to snooze the alarm (e.g., schedule a new notification for 9 minutes later)
        } else if (actionIdentifier === 'stop') {
            console.log(`User pressed "Stop" for alarm: ${alarmId}`);
            // Your logic to stop the alarm cycle
        }
    });

    return () => subscription.remove();
}, []);
```

### Summary: The Professional Alarm Flow

1.  **Don't try to auto-launch your app.** It's blocked by the OS.
2.  **Use a High-Priority Notification** with a `categoryIdentifier`. This is the "polite" way to ask the user to open your app for a critical event.
3.  **This notification takes over the lock screen**, effectively acting like a pop-up and showing custom action buttons ("Snooze", "Stop").
4.  **When the user interacts with the notification, your app opens.** Now that it's in the foreground, you can run your 30-minute light-up sequence without the OS killing it.

This approach respects the user's device and battery while still providing the powerful, time-critical functionality your alarm app needs.
