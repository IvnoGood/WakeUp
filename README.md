# WakeUp - A Smart Sunrise Alarm Clock

WakeUp is a mobile application for iOS and Android that transforms your smart lights into a gentle, natural sunrise alarm. Instead of a jarring sound, WakeUp gradually increases the brightness of your lights over a set period, simulating a real sunrise to help you wake up peacefully and naturally.

This app is designed to work with any smart light running the **WLED firmware**.


## üé• Quick Demo

*(This is where you would embed a short video or GIF showing the app in action. You can record your screen using your phone's built-in screen recorder and upload it to YouTube or convert it to a GIF.)*

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Gentle Sunrise Simulation:** Customize the duration of your sunrise, from a quick 5-minute glow to a long, 60-minute transition.
*   **WLED Integration:** Directly controls any WLED-powered device on your local network. No cloud accounts or third-party services needed.
*   **Multiple Alarms & Devices:** Add all your WLED lights and create unique alarms for weekdays, weekends, or special events.
*   ~~**Background Operation:** Alarms are scheduled with the native OS, so they will run reliably even if the app is closed.~~ (WIP üöß)
*   **Customizable Interface:** A clean, dark-mode interface designed to be easy on the eyes in the early morning.


## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started & Building the App

This project uses native capabilities (like background tasks and notifications) that are not fully supported by the standard Expo Go app. Therefore, you must create a **Development Build** to run and test it on your own device.

A development build is a full, standalone version of the app that includes all its native code, but it still connects to the Expo development server for live reloading and debugging.

### Prerequisites

1.  **A WLED-powered Smart Light:** This app communicates directly with devices running WLED.
    *   **How to install WLED:** Follow the official web-based installation guide.
        *   ‚û°Ô∏è **[Official WLED Installation Guide](https://kno.wled.ge/basics/install-binary/)**
    *   Find your device's **local IP address** (e.g., `192.168.1.59`). It must be on the same Wi-Fi network as your phone.

[!WARNING] Using the Expo Go app will not work see [documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) for more information

2.  **Expo & EAS Account:**
    *   You need an Expo account. [Sign up for free](https://expo.dev/signup).
    *   Log in to your account via the terminal:
        ```bash
        npx expo login
        ```

3.  **EAS Build CLI:**
    *   Install the Expo Application Services (EAS) command-line tool globally:
        ```bash
        npm install -g eas-cli
        ```

### Building and Running the Development Build

Follow these steps to create the app and install it on your physical device.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/wakeup.git
    cd wakeup
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create the Development Build:**
    *   This is the main command. It will build the app in the cloud using Expo's servers. Choose the platform you want to test on (iOS or Android).
    *   **For Android:**
        ```bash
        eas build --profile development --platform android
        ```
    *   **For iOS (Requires an Apple Developer Account):**
        ```bash
        eas build --profile development --platform ios
        ```
    *   The build process will take several minutes. When it's finished, it will output a URL and a QR code.

5.  **Install the App:**
    *   **On Android:** Scan the QR code with your phone's camera. This will download and install the `.apk` file. You may need to grant permission to install apps from unknown sources.
    *   **On iOS:** Open the link on your iPhone. It will guide you through installing the app via the Expo Dev-Client service.

6.  **Run the App:**
    *   Once the app is installed on your phone, you can start the development server on your computer:
        ```bash
        npx expo start --dev-client
        ```
    *   Open the **WakeUp** app you just installed on your phone (do **not** use the Expo Go app). It will automatically find and connect to the development server running on your computer.

## üöÄ How to Use the App

### 1. Adding a Device

The first step is to connect the app to your WLED light.

1.  Navigate to the **Home** tab.
2.  Tap the `+` button in the "Your devices" section.
3.  Enter the **IP Address** of your WLED device.
4.  Give your device a friendly name (e.g., "Bedroom Lamp").
5.  Tap **Save**.

### 2. Creating an Alarm

Once a device is added, you can create an alarm for it.

1.  Navigate to the **Alarms** tab or tap the main `+` button.
2.  Tap **"New Alarm"**.
3.  **Configure your alarm:**
    *   **Name:** Give your alarm a name (e.g., "Weekday Wakeup").
    *   **Device:** Select the WLED device you want this alarm to control.
    *   **Start Time:** The time you want the sunrise to *begin*.
    *   **Sunrise Duration:** How long the light-up process should take (e.g., 30 minutes). The app will automatically calculate the end time.
    *   **Max Brightness:** The final brightness level you want to reach.
4.  Tap **Save**.

The alarm is now scheduled! The app will automatically calculate the trigger time and use the operating system's scheduler to run the light-up sequence at the correct time. You can now close the app.
